# Mastermind Game
This game was originally a board game from 1970.

The player has to guess a number of five digits. After each guess the player gets hints to determine which digits are correct.
- Green stands for a number you guessed correctly and put in the right spot in the number array.
- Orange stands for a number you guessed correctly, but is not in the right spot of the number array.
- Red stands for a number you guessed that doesn't belong in the number array.
